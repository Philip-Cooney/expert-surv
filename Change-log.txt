Changelog:


Fixed issue in compute_ICS_stan function in which if the waic function from loo package could not evaluate waic an error would result.
Implement logarithmic pooling in the model (was given as an option but not implemented previously).
Modified the model.fit.plot from survHE to allow for plotting pml, waic etc.
Changed example to highlight the weights need to sum up to 1.
Tidied up the folder structure and removed uneeded files.
