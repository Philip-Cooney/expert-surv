Changelog:


Fixed issue in compute_ICS_stan function in which if the waic function from loo package could not evaluate waic an error would result.
Implement logarithmic pooling in the model (was given as an option but not implemented previously).
Modified the model.fit.plot from survHE to allow for plotting pml, waic etc.
Changed example to highlight the weights need to sum up to 1.
Tidied up the folder structure and removed uneeded files.

#Notes to self

To add something to the build ignore use this code usethis::use_build_ignore(c("man-roxygen"))
if the stan files cause an error on recompilation, delete all the src files, the config files and run rstantools::use_stan()

To stop the issue with big pdfs you have to isnstall qpdf and then set the path variable

old_path <- Sys.getenv("PATH")
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste( "C:\\Program Files\\qpdf 11.2.0\\bin",old_path, sep = ";"))
Sys.getenv()

#Submit to CRAN
Create Tarball
devtools::build() #Will create the tarball
R --vanilla CMD check C:/Users/phili/OneDrive/PhD/R_packages/expertsurv_1.0.0.tar.gz



#Future Updates
Need to update the ``expert_pooling`` function`to allow for integration with the SHINY app.
Need to remove attach
