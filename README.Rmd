# expert-surv

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of $\texttt{expertsurv}$ is to incorporate expert opinion into an analysis of time to event data. $\texttt{expertsurv}$ uses many of the core functions of the $\texttt{survHE}$ package [@Baio.2020]. Technical details of the implementation are detailed in [@Cooney.2021] and will not be repeated here. 


The key function is `fit.models.expert` and operates almost identically to the `fit.models` function of $\texttt{survHE}$.

## Expert Opinion on Survival at timepoints

If we have elicited expert opinion of the survival probability at certain timepoint(s) and assigned distributions to these beliefs, we encode that information as follows:

```{r}
#A param_expert object; which is a list of 
#length equal to the number of timepoints
param_expert_example1 <- list()

#If we have 1 timepoint and 2 experts
#dist is the names of the distributions
#wi is the weight assigned to each expert (usually 1)
#param1, param2, param3 are the parameters of the distribution
#e.g. for norm, param1 = mean, param2 = sd
#param3 is only used for the t-distribution and is the degress of freedom.
#We allow the following distributions:
#c("normal","t","gamma","lognormal","beta") 


param_expert_example1[[1]] <- data.frame(dist = c("norm","t"),
                                         wi = c(1,1),
                                         param1 = c(0.1,0.12),
                                         param2 = c(0.005,0.005),
                                         param3 = c(NA,3))
param_expert_example1

#Naturally we will specify the timepoint for which these probabilities where elicited

timepoint_expert <- 14

```

For details on assigning distributions to elicited probabilities and quantiles see the $\texttt{SHELF}$ package [@SHELF.2021] and for an overview on methodological approaches to eliciting expert opinion see [@OHagan.2019].

```

data2 <- survHE::data %>% rename(status = censored) %>% mutate(time2 = ifelse(time > 10, 10, time),
                                                              status2 = ifelse(time> 10, 0, status))

#Set the opinion type to "survival"

example1  <- expertsurv:::fit.models.expert(formula=Surv(time2,status2)~1,data=data2,
                                        distr=c("wei"),
                                        method="hmc",
                                        iter = 5000,
                                        opinion_type = "survival",
                                        times_expert = timepoint_expert, 
                                        param_expert = param_expert_example1)



```

```
 plot(example1, add.km = T, t = 0:30)+
  theme_light()+
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,NA), breaks=seq(0, 30, 2)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, NA), breaks=seq(0, 1, 0.05))

```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Survival function with Expert prior"}
knitr::include_graphics("Vignette_Example 1.png")
```

## Expert Opinion on Survival of a comparator arm


In this situation we place an opinion on the comparator arm.

```
param_expert_example2[[1]] <- data.frame(dist = c("norm"),
                                         wi = c(1),
                                         param1 = c(0.1),
                                         param2 = c(0.005),
                                         param3 = c(NA))
```

```{r}
#Check the coding of the arm variable
#Comparator is 0, which is our id_St
unique(survHE::data$arm)

```

```
survHE.data.model  <- expertsurv:::fit.models.expert(formula=Surv(time2,status2)~as.factor(arm),data=data2,
                                        distr=c("wei"),
                                        method="hmc",
                                        iter = 5000,
                                        opinion_type = "survival",
                                        id_St = 0, 
                                        times_expert = timepoint_expert, 
                                        param_expert = param_expert_example2)
```

We can remove the impact of expert opinion by running the same model in the $\texttt{survHE}$ package. Alternatively we note that a $\mathcal{B}(1,1)$ distribution is uniform on the survival probability and does not change the likelihood. 

```
param_expert_vague <- list()
param_expert_vague[[1]] <- data.frame(dist = "beta", wi = 1, param1 = 1, param2 = 1, param2 = NA)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Survival function with Expert prior (left) and Vague prior (right)"}
knitr::include_graphics("Vignette_Example 2.png")
```

The survival function for "arm 1" has been shifted downwards slightly, however the covariate for the accelerated time factor has markedly increased to counteract the lower survival probability for the reference (arm 0).

## Expert Opinion on Survival Difference

This example illustrates an opinion on the survival difference.
For illustration we use the Gompterz, noting that a negative shape parameter will lead to a proportion of subjects living forever.
Clearly the mean is not defined in these cases so the code automatically constrains the shape to be positive. 

```
param_expert3 <- list()

#Prior belief of 5 "months" difference in expected survival
param_expert3[[1]] <- data.frame(dist = "norm", wi = 1, param1 = 5, param2 = 0.2, param3 = NA)


survHE.data.model  <- expertsurv:::fit.models.expert(formula=Surv(time2,status2)~as.factor(arm),data=data2,
                                                     distr=c("gom"),
                                                     method="hmc",
                                                     iter = 5000,
                                                     opinion_type = "mean",
                                                     id_trt = 1, # Survival difference is Mean_surv[id_trt]- Mean_surv[id_comp] 
                                                     param_expert = param_expert3)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Survival difference"}
knitr::include_graphics("Vignette_Example 3.png")
```
