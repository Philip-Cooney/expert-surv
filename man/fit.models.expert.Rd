\description{
Implementation of survival models with expert opinion on the survival probabilities or expected difference in survival.
Function is equivalent to the \code{fit.models} in \code{survHE} expect for the inclusion of the "expert_type" and "param_expert" arguments.
Worked examples can be found in the \href{README.md}{README} file.
Note that the default method is "hmc", however, the user may use "mle" or "inla" for analysis without expert opinion.
